# Portal - Dev Sprint 82
**Usability improvements**

In this sprint, we focused on improving several features in portal. Additionally to a brand new editing experience for CashBox-Templates we also added a long requested feature to display the raw content of receipts to the receipts page. One thing that we also want to highlight is the Prod release of the FR Market.

## Features

### E-Commerce

#### Enable Shop for FR (FR)

We are really happy to announce that we enabled the French shop. Starting by now you are able to purchase products in the French Portal.

If you want to have more details on the products, or are interested to work with us in France in general, feel free to reach out to our FR sales team [sales@fiskaltrust.fr](mailto:sales@fiskaltrust.fr).

#### Improved visualization of products  (DE)

After enabling the digital products in the shop in sprint 81, we wanted to make sure that we are also improving the product visualization. For this purposes we added pictures and additional details to the product description to make it easier for the users to get details on the different products.

For more details or if you are interested in one of these products please reach out to our DE sales team [sales@fiskaltrust.de](mailto:sales@fiskaltrust.de).


#### Improve experience when purchasing outlet based products (DE, FR)

Since most of the outlet-based products can be bought only once, we wanted to make sure that users are not accidentally paying twice for products that they don't need. For this purpose we are showing an error message if the user puts a product into the cart that is already available for this location. Additionally we prevent buying more than 1 of these products per outlet.

Some of our products require the selection of an outlet. Beside the outlet based products themselves, a outlet must be selected for the French Cha√ÆneCloud. If one of these products is put into the cart without selecting an outlet beforehand, an error message is shown.

### Middleware Configuration

#### New interface for editing CashBox templates (All markets)

We added a new functionality for editing the content of cashbox templates. With the newly integrated JSON editor it should be far easier to create, edit and check cashbox templates. Additionally to these new editing capabilities, the JSON editor highlights JSON errors to make it easier to spot potential issues.

We also added a tree view to the JSON editor to make it easier to go through very big CashBox templates.

Currently the JSON editor checks for basic JSON syntax errors only. Since the CashBox template has a fixed structure we will further improve the validation by adding a specific schema in one of the next sprints. 

#### Hiding packages that do not have versions (All markets)

In some cases it happened that even though a package was shown in the selection dialog, it was not possible to select a version. We added a check to make sure that we are only showing packages that have valid versions available.

#### Showing raw data of receipts (All markets)

We got the feedback that in some situations it would be very helpful if PosDealers and PosCreators are able to see the raw data that has been sent to the Middleware. We added a JSON viewer that shows the raw data for both the _request.json_ and the _response.json_.

## Next steps
In the next sprints we will continue to improve the usability and the user experience in the portal to make sure that it is easy to use. Additionally, we will continue adding new features that help our customers meeting the challenges that they are facing in the German market including things like revision safe storage for customers that don't use the middleware, the final release of the auto-invitation process and also TAR based functionalities.
