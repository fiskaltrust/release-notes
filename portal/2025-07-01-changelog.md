# Platform 2025-27

This release includes performance improvements and user experience enhancements delivered from July to September. Key highlights include performance optimizations for customers with large numbers of cashboxes, German notification management improvements with automated date handling and enhanced guidance, PosSystem pages performance improvements, and added outlet number visibility across all table views to streamline workflows.


## Cashbox Loading Performance Improvements
<sub>Available since July 14, 2025</sub>

**Affected markets:** ALL  

**Improved:** Significantly enhanced performance for customers with large numbers of cashboxes (1000+) in their accounts. The portal was previously very slow and barely usable for these customers, but performance improvements now allow even customers with 50,000+ cashboxes to load data in reasonable time.

**Why it matters:** Ensures the platform remains responsive and usable for enterprise customers with extensive cashbox deployments, improving their daily workflow efficiency and user experience.

**Next steps:** We will continue to improve performance by focusing on optimizing load times for Signature Creation Units (SCU/TSE) data.

**Why it matters:** Provides a solution for German notification management by reducing data entry errors, offering clearer guidance and troubleshooting support, enabling manual control over notification timing, and improving operator communication. These enhancements reduce support requests while ensuring faster compliance processing and better user experience.

## PosSystem Pages Performance Improvements

## Outlet Number Visibility Enhancement
