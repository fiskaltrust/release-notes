# Platform 2025-43

This release introduces Product Page Improvements.

<sub>Available since December 2025</sub>

**Affected markets:** ALL

## Shop/Products Page Improvement

**Improved:** Outlet selection is now mandatory when placing an order. The "No Outlet" option has been removed, and Outlet 1 is automatically set as the default selection.

**Why it matters:** This change ensures that every order is properly assigned to an outlet, preventing potential issues with order fulfillment. By making outlet selection mandatory and setting a sensible default, the system reduces user errors and improves data accuracy across the platform.
