This Sprint’s main goals were improving the user experience of the Subscriptions Page, as well as the new Cases View page in Portal.


## Features

### Middleware Configuration

- [Reworked Subscriptions Page DE & FR](#Reworked-Subscriptions-Page-DE-&-FR)
- [Reworked Employees Page](#Reworked-Employees-Page)

### Support

## Middleware Configuration

### Reworked Subscriptions Page DE & FR

The Subscription Pages for DE and FR have been reworked and improved.
Users can now enjoy a better experience while navigating through those pages, as the performance times have been improved and the page can now handle bigger amounts of data better.
Features such as user warning when canceling subscription if a renewal product is in the shopping cart, as well as the disabling of the renewal button for cancelled subscriptions have been included.
