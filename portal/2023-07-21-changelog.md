# Further steps in redesigning of landing page

We have improved our landing pages in the sandbox:  

* [Sandbox Austria](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/ "Sandbox AT")
* [Sandbox France](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/ "Sandbox France") 
* [Sandbox Germany](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/ "Sandbox  Germany")
* [Sandbox Italy](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.it/ "Sandbox Italy")
* [Sandbox Spain](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.es/ "Sandbox Spain")  

These pages are now:

* optimized for mobile devices as well
* supplemented with the logos of our partners
* showing a one-liner for some of our products. 

The new design improves visual appeal and usability for current and potential partners.

# Launch of our PosDealer API

We have published a new [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13633406/2s93z584ZJ) for our PosDealer API. You may start using the PosDealer API by retrieving a list with all your PosOperators relevant data for further actions. You can further invite new PosOperators, and create and manage outlets for them. Then you can check available entitlements and use Rollout plans for your PosOperators. Finally, you can use templates to create your Middleware configurations.
All operations that the PosDealer API offers are also available in the fiskaltrust.Portal, if you prefer to use a graphical user interface over this API.
