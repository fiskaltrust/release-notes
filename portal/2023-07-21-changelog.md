# Further steps in redesign of landing page

We have improved our landing pages in the sandbox:  

* [Sandbox Austria](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/ "Sandbox AT")
* [Sandbox France](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/ "Sandbox France") 
* [Sandbox Germany](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/ "Sandbox  Germany")
* [Sandbox Italy](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.it/ "Sandbox Italy")
* [Sandbox Spain](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.es/ "Sandbox Spain")  

These pages now:

* optimized for mobile devices as well
* supplemented with the logos of our partners. 

The new design improves visual appeal and usability for current and potential partners.

# Launch of our PosDealer API

We have published _here_ a Postman Collection for our PosDealer API. You may start using the PosDealer API by retrieving a list with all your PosOperators' relevant data for further actions. You can further invite new PosOperators, and create and manage outlets for them. Then you can check available permissions and use Rollout plans accordingly to transfer entitlements and produce subscriptions for your customers. Finally, you can use the template endpoint to create Middleware configurations.
All operations that the PosDealer API offers are also available in the fiskaltrust.Portal, if you prefer to use a graphical user interface over this API.
