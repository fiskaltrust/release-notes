# Platform 2025-36

The main focus of this release is to improve existing processes and fix minor bugs.

## Exports Redirection Fix
**Fixed:** Navigating to exports no longer redirects users to the legacy exports page. Users are now correctly redirected to the new exports page.

**Why it matters:*** The new page includes features not available in the legacy version, such as displaying the current state of exports, along with improved performance and reliability.

## Subscription Extension Issue Resolved
**Fixed:** Users were previously unable to extend subscriptions for Notifications, Cloud Cashbox Swissbit, and Cloud Cashbox Fiskaly Single products. This issue has now been resolved, and subscription extensions for these products are fully functional.

**Why it matters:** Ensures uninterrupted service for users by allowing timely subscription renewals for all supported products.

## Queue Configuration Outlet Messaging Improvements
**Improved:** Added a descriptive message on the Queue Configuration page when a configured outlet is not found. The system no longer silently defaults to outlet number 1 without explanation.

**Why it matters:** Helps POS operators and POS dealers clearly identify the real issue before contacting support, reducing confusion and troubleshooting time by avoiding misleading defaults.

## Role Management Clarity Improvements
**Improved:** Enhanced the role management interface to clearly indicate when roles have been disabled. When a role is deactivated, users now see a descriptive message explaining the status and how to re-enable it, such as "The PosCreator role has been disabled. If you want to enable it again, please use the toggle to start the sign process again."

**Why it matters:** Eliminates confusion about role activation status and provides clear guidance for users who need to re-enable roles, reducing support inquiries and improving user experience.
