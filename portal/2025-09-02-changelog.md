# Platform 2025-36

The main focus of this release is to improve existing processes and fix minor bugs.

## Exports Redirection Fix
**Fixed:** Navigating to exports no longer redirects users to the legacy exports page. Users are now correctly redirected to the new exports page.

**Why it matters:*** The new page includes features not available in the legacy version, such as displaying the current state of exports, along with improved performance and reliability.
