# Platform 2025-36

The main focus of this release is to improve existing processes and fix minor bugs.

## Exports Redirection Fix
**Fixed:** Navigating to exports no longer redirects users to the legacy exports page. Users are now correctly redirected to the new exports page.

**Why it matters:*** The new page includes features not available in the legacy version, such as displaying the current state of exports, along with improved performance and reliability.

## Subscription Extension Issue Resolved
**Fixed:** Users were previously unable to extend subscriptions for Notifications, Cloud Cashbox Swissbit, and Cloud Cashbox Fiskaly Single products. This issue has now been resolved, and subscription extensions for these products are fully functional.

**Why it matters:** Ensures uninterrupted service for users by allowing timely subscription renewals for all supported products.
