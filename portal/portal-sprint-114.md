### Datamanagement

- [Rework receiptjournal and actionjournal list experience](#rework-receiptjournal-and-actionjournal-list-experience)

### POSDealer Experience

- [Add scrolling for rollout summary](#add-scrolling-for-rollout-summary)

## Datamanagement

### Rework receiptjournal and actionjournal list experience

We have improved the receipt journal and the action journal lists to be more performant and user friendly.

## POSDealer Experience

### Add scrolling for rollout summary

In case of users that have used the rolloutmanagement for performing the rollout for many outlets at once the summary that showed up was getting a bit difficult to read. We have added scrolling capabilities so that users can focus on the most important bits of the summary even if they are performing bigger rollouts.

## Next steps

In the next weeks, we will focus on adding additional capabilities for making sales processes easier.

## Feedback
We would love to hear what you think about these improvements and fixes. To get in touch, please reach out to [feedback+portal@fiskaltrust.cloud](mailto:feedback+portal@fiskaltrust.cloud).
