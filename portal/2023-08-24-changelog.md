# CashBox configuration extended with PIN for InStore App!

We are pleased to announce a new feature for CashBox configuration in the fiskaltrust.Portal.

<!-- truncate -->
As an InStore App user, you needed a convenient way to connect your InStore App to your CashBox. You did not want to manually enter the CashBox ID and access token on your digital device.

Pairing an **InStore App** with a CashBox uses a temporary PIN that our system recognizes. This PIN is now displayed in the fiskaltrust.Portal.

## What is included?

In the details of a CashBox, a line for the **PIN for the InStore App** is now included.  
A `refresh button` will obtain you with a new PIN. That new PIN is displayed for five minutes for security reasons.

## How do I get started?

For more information about the InStore App configuration, please read [InStore App](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/de/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/digital-receipt/instore-app).

Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve. [Reach out to us](mailto:feedback+portal@fiskaltrust.cloud).
