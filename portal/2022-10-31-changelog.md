# Improve delete dialog for removing CashBoxes

A checkbox in the table at Configuration/CashBox is displayed for each row that the user can select to remove CashBoxes.

All corresponding rows can also be marked with a selection box above.

Another "Delete" button is added at the top of the CashBox table, which validates the selected CashBoxes and displays a confirmation dialog.

A confirmation dialog that includes valid and invalid cash register information will be displayed before deleting CashBoxes.
