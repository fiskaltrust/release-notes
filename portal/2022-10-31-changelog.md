# Improve delete dialog for removing cashbox

A checkbox in the table at Configuration/Cashboxes is displayed for each row that the user can select to remove Cashboxes.

All corresponding rows can also be marked with a selection box above.

Another "Delete" button is added at the top of the CashBox table, which validates the selected cashboxes and displays a confirmation dialog.

A confirmation dialog that includes valid and invalid cash register information will be displayed before deleting cashboxes.
