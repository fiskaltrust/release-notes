:::caution

Version 1.2.6 doesn´t support Android 15+ yet!

:::


## Stability: Robust payment processing

We improved reliability for payment processing to survive app crashes and Android OOMKiller events. Payments now recover correctly after interruptions, with better retry and result handling.

_Affected issues:_  
#164, #165, #168, #171, #199, #210, #222, #241

## New payment providers: support for Softpay.io and Hobex POSit

You can now process payments with Softpay.io and Hobex POSit directly in the InStoreApp.

_Affected issues:_  
#99, #203

---

## Extended Viva Payment: ISV support

Viva Payments integration now supports ISV credentials via configuration in the fiskaltrust backend. Partners can use their own ISV credentials for additional transaction options.

_Affected issue:_  
#230

---

## Automatic start after device boot

The InStoreApp now automatically starts in the background after device boot if the foreground setting is enabled.

_Affected issue:_  
#286
