# InStore App 1.2.8
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/milestone-v1.2.8-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/fiskaltrust-instore-app/milestone/4?closed=1) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Landscape display support

This release introduces full landscape support, enabling users to operate the InStore App seamlessly on devices with landscape orientation and smaller screens. The user interface now adapts automatically to different display configurations.

_Affected issue:_  
[Landscape support] allows to use the full functionality on landscape and smaller displays [#356](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/fiskaltrust-instore-app/issues/356) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Receipt preview: head down rotation support

The receipt preview can now be rotated correctly when the device is turned upside down. This allows staff to easily show receipts to guests by simply rotating the device.

_Affected issue:_  
[Receipt Preview] support to rotate the preview of the receipt to be rotated correctly when the user shows it to guests via rotating the device head down [#304](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/fiskaltrust-instore-app/issues/304) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Payment in progress screen

A new payment status screen has been added that displays information about ongoing payment transactions. This provides clear visual feedback during payment processing instead of showing the Home screen.

_Affected issue:_  
[Payment] add a new status / in progress screen (like "Payment starting...") that can show information about ongoing payment transactions so that we do not show the Home screen at this time [#226](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/fiskaltrust-instore-app/issues/226) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
