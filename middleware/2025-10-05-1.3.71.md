# Middleware 1.3.71 (Germany, Austria, European Union, Spain, Portugal, Greece)
In this version of the Middleware, our focus was on implementing Queue EU and solving some minor issues in queues and SCUs in Germany and Austria.
<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

:::
## Feature: Introduce QueueEU
??
## Bug Fix: Serialization with System.Text.Json contains escaped characters

Fix character escaping for QueueItem (both request and response), and wherever necessary to ensure compatibility with external systems.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*
  
## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: JournalFunction provided incorrect details

The journal endpoint /json/v0/Journal?type=0 is intended to return detailed information about the middleware version.

:::info

Previously, this endpoint returned a generic name and version that did not accurately reflect the middleware in use. This issue has now been resolved, and the endpoint correctly returns the specific middleware information.

:::

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: Queue SQLite always showed a pending database on startup

The SQLite queue previously indicated a pending database update every time it started, even after the update had already been applied. This has now been fixedâ€”the correct version is now saved in the database, preventing repeated updates on subsequent startups.
:::

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: SwissbitCloud throwing errors on startup

The SwissbitCloud SCU was throwing startup errors that didnâ€™t impact its actual functionality, like "Failed to execute GetTseInfoAsync"

:::info

These errors occurred because the system attempted to request the TseInfo before the FCC had fully initialized. Since FCC initialization happens only once per system, the process has now been updated to wait until the FCC setup is complete before making the request.
:::

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: Fix logtimeformat casing in DE.Epson SCU

The issue is that the Epson SCU uses "UnixTime" (with a capital "U" and "T") in the QR code payload, whereas it should be "unixtime" in lowercaseâ€”this mismatch causes problems with the FinanzCheck app.
:::

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Epson

## AT Improvement: Use v0 of IATSSCD 

The SCUs version 1.3 supports the online SCU endpoint:  signing[-sandbox].fiskaltrust.at.

:::info

The online SCU: signing[-sandbox].fiskaltrust.at is still running on 1.2.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*

## DE Improvement: End2End Testing for SwissbitCloud V2

SCUConfiguration related to SwissbitCloudV2 has been updated to contain required endpoints and certificationId.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2

## DE Bug Fix: Nullpointer on timerange export

For a very rare case we needed to increase the search span for the actionjournal.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*

## End2End Testing for SwissbitCloud V2

We have finished final tests for SwissbitCloud V2 and updated settings for production.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2
