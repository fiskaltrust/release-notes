# Middleware 1.3.70 (Germany, Italy)
In this version of the Middleware we've updated [Bring Your Own Datacenter](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/product-de-bring-your-own-datacenter/).

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.
