# Middleware 1.3.59 (Germany)
This version of the Middleware is mainly focused on improving the memory consumption when working with large databases, especially related to handling large TAR exports from TSEs. Additionally, we've fixed issues that prevented TAR exports from the Middleware or the fiskaly TSE in specific rare cases.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unifyed version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Added optional, fast digital receipt upload to BYODC
We've added an optional configuration switch to the _Bring your own Data Center_ image that supports uploading digital receipts immediately, allowing its users to provide a seamless digital receipt experience to end consumers. 

The feature can be turned on like this:
1. Ensure that you're using the latest version of the Helm chart, and set the `posApi.baseUrl` value in ByoDC's Helm chart (either to `https://pos-api-sandbox.fiskaltrust.cloud` for sandbox or `https://pos-api.fiskaltrust.cloud` for production installations)
2. Set the `useposapi` Queue property of affected Middleware Queues to `true` in the Portal, and rebuild the respective Cashboxes.

### Affected packages
- _BYODC (Docker image) 1.3.59_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Stability improvement: Decrease memory footprint when processing TAR exports
We've implemented various improvements both in the Middleware's Queue packages and in the Swissbit SCU package to reduce the memory footprint when processing TAR exports. This affects internal processes like the automatic TSE export during the daily closing ([fiskaltrust/middleware#281](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/281)) and when performing uploads, as well as external requests to the `/journal` endpoint ([fiskaltrust/middleware#284](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/284/files)).

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.59_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Swissbit v1.3.59_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug fix: Split large fiskaly exports [fiskaltrust/middleware#207](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/207)
We've fixed an issue that prevented the fiskaly TAR export when the maximum size of signatures exceeded fiskaly's limit of 1 million transactions; requests for large exports will now be internally split up and combined after download.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Fiskaly v1.3.59_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug fix: Fixed wrong record delimiter in DSFinV-K exports
We've fixed a minor issue in our DSFinV-K export that lead to a warning in Amadeus Verify because of a non-matching record delimiter in the CSV schema definitions.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.59_
