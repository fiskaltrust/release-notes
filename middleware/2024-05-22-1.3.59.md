# Middleware 1.3.59 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we have fixed a memory problem when exporting tar Files via daily closing. We also fixed memory problems on the Journalcall for exporting tar files. But in Rest the solution is not fully effective as of missing objects in given library. When exporting big tar files, this could now lead to Helipad not beeing able to upload, we are working on that one.

[fiskaltrust/middleware/issue#281](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/281)
Additionlly we have update the Tar Export to version 1.1.2, to leave out corrupt log files in the tar export from the middleware (database)
