# Middleware 1.3.64 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've added the migration receipt for switching local installations to the CloudCashbox, and fixed an issue that prevented DSFinV-K exports on Queues that were initially set-up during the pilot phase in Germany.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unifyed version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Added new receipt type to start a "local to cloud" migration
We've added the new ftReceiptCase `` to the German Middleware, which prepares the Queue to be migrated to the CloudCashbox with the upcoming migration wizard in the Portal. When this receipt is sent, the Queue is set to "readonly" mode to prevent data mismatches between the local and cloud version.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.* v1.3.64_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug fix: Creating DSFinV-K exports failed for Queues that were installed during the pilot phase in Germany
Due to an incompatibility with data from very old Queues that were initially installed and used with the first Middleware versions we had released in Germany, DSFinV-K exports could fail in some cases when the data produced by this versions was included. We'ved fixed this, and exports over the whole time range should now be fully possible again (both in the local Middleware and the cloud exports).

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.* v1.3.64_
