# Middleware 1.3.60 (Germany, Italy)
In this version of the Middleware, we've fixed an incompatibility of our Android Launcher with Android 14, and additional capabilities for working with Epson RT Printers.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unifyed version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Feature: Introduce support for printing X-Reports to EpsonRTPrinter ([fiskaltrust/middleware#299](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/299))

We've added support for printing X-Reports as part of the ZeroReceipt.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.IT.EpsonRTPrinter v1.3.60_

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Bug: Allow to send negative amounts for reduction of price of line items ([fiskaltrust/middleware#301](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/301))

One of the use cases we have been made aware of is sending reduction / adjustments for line items. We didn't support this in the past which lead to the printer throwing an error and the Middleware returning EEEE_EEEE. In this release we have fixed this issue and negative amounts are now correctly printed onto the receipt.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.IT.EpsonRTPrinter v1.3.60_

## ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Bug fix: Android Launcher fails to start on Android 14
We've fixed an issue in the Android Launcher that prevented successfully starting the background service on Android 14, resulting in a "missing permission" error message. 

### Affected packages
- _Android Launcher 1.3.60_
