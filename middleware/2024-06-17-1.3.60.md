# Middleware 1.3.60 (Germany, Italy)
In this version of the Middleware, we've fixed an incompatibility of our Android Launcher with Android 14, and [TODO IT].

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unifyed version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

:::

## Bug fix:
We've fixed an issue in the Android Launcher that prevented successfully starting the background service on Android 14, resulting in a "missing permission" error message. 

### Affected packages
- _Android Launcher 1.3.60_
