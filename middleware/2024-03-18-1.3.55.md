# Middleware 1.3.55 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware:
We started our feature of enhancing error handling in the middleware and saved relevant data and addional information on queue startup.
We enabled Dsfinvk-Export to provide Tse Serial and Certificate when Queue is in failed mode.
We updated the Fiskal Cloud Connector (FCC) to version 4.0.8 and enabled setting the metrix parameter

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.
