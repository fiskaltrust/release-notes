# Middleware 1.3.55 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've updated the _Fiskal Cloud Connector_ to version 4.0.8, added fallback mechanisms to always include TSE information in DSFinV-K exports in edge cases, and store some additional data for improved tracebility and diagnostics.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug fix: DSFinV-K now contains TSE serial and certificate when Queue was in failed mode during daily receipt [fiskaltrust/middleware#257](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/257)
In previous versions of the Middleware, certain TSE information like the serial number and the certificate where not properly added to the DSFinV-K export in some scenarios where the TSE was not reachable during a daily closing receipt. We've introduced several fallback steps for this, ensuring that these fields will be filled.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.55_

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Update FCC to 4.0.8 in SwissbitCloud and DF SCUs [fiskaltrust/middleware#253] (https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/253)
We've updated the _Fiskal Cloud Connector_ (the background service used by the _Deutsche Fiskal_ and _SwissbitCloud_ TSEs use) to the latest version, which includes stability improvements. When updating to this version of the SCU, the new FCC version is automatically installed.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.55_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud v1.3.55_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Support enabling FCC metrics [fiskaltrust/middleware#259] (https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/259)
For people who directly obtained cloud TSEs from Deutsche Fiskal or Swissbit, it's now possible to enable collecting FCC metrics to use the Deutsche Fiskal monitoring service (embedded into their Portal) - this can be enabled by setting the optional Queue parameter `EnableFccMetrics` to `true`.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.55_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud v1.3.55_


## Stability improvement: Create ActionJournal entry on queue startup containing queue infos [fiskaltrust/middleware#260](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/260)
The Middleware now creates an ActionJournal entry on each start containing details about the current configuration, which will make tracing issues easier for our support as well as our PosDealers.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.55_
