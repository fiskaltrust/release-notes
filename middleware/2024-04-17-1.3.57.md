# Middleware 1.3.57 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've fixed an incompatibility with a change in the FCC interface in our SwissbitCloud and DeutscheFiskal SCUs that prevented initializing new TSEs. This issue was introduced with the Middleware version 1.3.56 and is related to the FCC version 4.1.1.

:::danger

Please note that this mandatory update of the FCC needs to be rolled out **until July 31st 2024** to remain compliant to the German regulations. The Deutsche Fiskal will disable signing for previous FCC versions on this date.

Refer to [our documentation](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/technical-operations/maintenance/updating) to learn how to update the installations of connected PosOperators.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug fix: Fixed registering clients in FCC 4.1.1+ [fiskaltrust/middleware#276](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/276)
We've fixed an issue that prevented initializing new TSEs with the SwissbitCloud and DeutscheFiskal SCUs. The FCC 4.1.1 now expects the `TypeOfSystem` to be set during client registration, which the Middleware did not send previously.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.57_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud v1.3.57_
