# Middleware 1.3.62 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've updated the Swissbit hardware SDK to the latest version and modified our Android Launcher to prevent the TSE from being turned off on Android devices with very limited hardware.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unifyed version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Stability improvement: Added WakeLock to Android Launcher to prevent hardware TSEs from being turned off
The Middleware for Android is now acquiring an Android WakeLock when a Swissbit SCU is hosted. This is required on very few types of devices (namely on the PAX920 payment terminal) to prevent the TSE from being switched off or disconnected, which required constant self-tests before this version, rendering the TSE unusable.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.AndroidLauncher.Http v1.3.61_
- _fiskaltrust.AndroidLauncher.Grpc v1.3.62_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Stability improvement: Updated the Swissbit hardware TSE SDK to v5.9.3
We've updated the SDK our Swissbit hardware SCU uses to the latest version to benefit from the newest improvements (mostly stability-related).

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Swissbit v1.3.62_
