# Middleware 1.3.44 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware we solved a bug happening when creating a local DSFinV-K export.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## Bug Fix: Exception when creating a DSFinV-K Export
We've fixed an issue in 1.3.43 Queues which lead to an Exception when creating local DSFinV-K exports. If you experienced this issue please update to 1.3.44 and retrigger the export.
### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF v1.3.44_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL v1.3.44_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite v1.3.44_

## Next steps in the Middleware
We will focus on developing of an italian version of the fiskaltrust.Launcher in the next sprints.
This version will be developed open-source, and our first public prototype can be found in the public repository https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware-launcher.

As always, we're happy to hear feedback and suggestions via [feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud](mailto:feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud) or directly via issues in our GitHub repositories.
