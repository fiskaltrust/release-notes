# Middleware 1.3.75
 [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/milestone-v1.3.75-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/milestone/7?closed=1)

 
In this version of the Middleware, our focus was on implementing Queue EU and solving some minor issues in queues and SCUs in Germany and Austria.
<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only (with Spain, Grece and Portugal currently in the works).
Customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
We are currently testing a unified version for all markets.

:::

## ☁️ Feature: Introduce QueueEU ([fiskaltrust/middleware#254](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/254))

We've introduced the European Union as new Market to the Queue. It is currently only available on the CloudCashbox.
It allows the Middleware to be used in all markets accross Europe for Archiving/Exporting purposes and for the Digital Receipt with more features to come.

If you are interested or have questions please reach out to us.

## 🇪🇸🇵🇹🇬🇷 Bug Fix: Serialization with System.Text.Json contains escaped characters ([fiskaltrust/middleware#384](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/384))

Fix character escaping for QueueItem (both request and response), and wherever necessary to ensure compatibility with external systems.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_
  
## 🇩🇪 Bug Fix: Fiskaly Exports not using the Temp folder ([fiskaltrust/middleware#461](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/461))
## AT🇩🇪FR Bug Fix: Don't return EEEE_EEEE responses by ReceiptRequest flag ([fiskaltrust/middleware#469](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/469))

In the past, we introduced the ftState 0xEEEE_EEEE error in V2 tagging for the older markets (AT, DE, FR) such that a QueueItem was created and the error was logged, but it wasn’t included in the response to avoid disrupting existing installations. In contrast, in V1 tagging, the error is returned directly in the response.

This could result in a situation where a receipt fails under V1, returning a 500 error, and internally a QueueItem with ftState 0xEEEE_EEEE is generated. When the POS system retries the receipt using the Receipt-Request Flag, the system returns the previously failed receipt (with the ftState 0xEEEE_EEEE) instead of returning an empty result.

:::info

This issue has been resolved. Now, when a receipt with ftState 0xEEEE_EEEE is requested using the Receipt-Request Flag, it will only be returned if V2 tagging is used in the request.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_
## 🇩🇪 Feature: Daily-Closing Flag which closes all open transactions ([fiskaltrust/middleware#212](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/212))

We introduced a new ftReceiptCaseFlag (0x0000000200000000) to the Daily Closing, which closes all open transactions on the TSE when a daily closing is performed.

:::info

This solves the problem of open transactions from other queues, in a setup where  muultiple queues are used on one tse.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_

## 🌐 Bug Fix: Queue SQLite always showed a pending database update on startup ([fiskaltrust/middleware#411](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/411))

The SQLite queue previously indicated a pending database update every time it started, even after the update had already been applied. This has now been fixed. The correct version is now saved in the database, preventing repeated updates on subsequent startups.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite_

## 🇩🇪 Bug Fix: SwissbitCloud throwing errors on startup ([fiskaltrust/middleware#412](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/412))

The SwissbitCloud SCU was throwing startup errors that didn’t impact its actual functionality, like `Failed to execute GetTseInfoAsync`

:::info

These errors occurred because the system attempted to request the TseInfo before the FCC had fully initialized. Since FCC initialization happens only once per system, the process has now been updated to wait until the FCC setup is complete before making the request.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud_

## 🇩🇪 Bug Fix: Fix logtimeformat casing in DE.Epson SCU ([fiskaltrust/middleware#429](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/429))

We've fixed an issue where previously on DE.Epson TSEs the Log Time Format was set to "UnixTime" instead of "unixtime".

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Epson_

## 🇦🇹 Bug Fix: Fix OnlineSCU access from the Queue ([fiskaltrust/middleware#415](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/415))

We've fixed a problem the Austrian 1.3 implementation had when accessing the OnlineSCU.

:::info

The 1.3 version of the middleware is in preview for the Austrian market.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_

## 🇩🇪 New SCU: SwissbitCloud V2 SCU is now available

The new SwissbitCloudV2 SCU is now available in the German market and can be rolled out.

Since this SCU is fully hosted in the cloud, it's not using a local component like the FCC that the old SwissbitCloud had, making operation of this new version a lot simpler.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2_

## 🇩🇪 Bug Fix: Nullpointer on timerange export ([fiskaltrust/middleware#425](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/425))

We've fixed a rare nullpointer exception during a DSFinV-K export that occurred on some setups.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_
