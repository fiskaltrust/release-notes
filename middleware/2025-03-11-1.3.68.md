# Middleware 1.3.68 (Germany, Italy)
In this version of the Middleware our focus was on improving the DSFinV-K and DFKA export,
and making the middleware and cloud cashbox more robust.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## 🇩🇪 Improvement: Improve DSFinV-K and DFKA export

We have improved the DSFinV-K and DFKA export to be more robust and to handle more edge cases.
Notably the `BON_NAME` column is now also filled with the correct data if no `PayItem` is sent.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage v1.3.68_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF v1.3.68_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL v1.3.68_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite v1.3.68_


## ☁️ Bug: Handle special characters in the `cbReceiptReference` field in the fiskaltrust.CloudCashbox ([fiskaltrust/middleware#378](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/378))

We have fixed an issue where special characters (`/`, `\`, `#`, `?`) in the `cbReceiptReference` field were not handled correctly.
This issue lead to these receipts not being signed and has been resolved and the Middleware now correctly handles special characters in this field.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage v1.3.68_


## 🇮🇹 Bug: `NullReferenceException` when reprinting receipt ([fiskaltrust/middleware#396](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/396))

We have fixed an issue where the Middleware was loading failed receipts when processing reprint, refund, and void operations.

## 🇩🇪 Bug: Error when SCU-Switching to SwissbitCloud and DeutscheFiskal ([fiskaltrust/middleware#392](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/392))

We have improved the stability of the SCU-Switch to SwissbitCloud and DeutscheFiskal TSEs.
