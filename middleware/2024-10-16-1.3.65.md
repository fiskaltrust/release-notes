# Middleware 1.3.65 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've made migrations from BYODC to the CloudCashbox easier by automatically redirecting requests, and fixed an issue that prevented TAR exports from TSEs on old Android devices from specific vendors.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: BYODC now automatically acts as a proxy when mistakenly used with a CloudCashbox Queue
BYODC installations now automatically identify if the used Queue/Cashbox should be running in fiskaltrust's SaaS Middleware (i.e. the _CloudCashbox_), and automatically re-route the requests there instead of processing it itself. This is especially meant for migration scenarios, and should simplify the switch to the CloudCashbox significantly - after the migration wizard in the Portal finished, local POS configurations don't need to be changed immediately for the system to use the new URL, but can be gradually moved.

BYODC uses the Queue's URL to identify if this mechanism should be used, and check's if it's set to `https://cloudcashbox[-sandbox].fiskaltrust.cloud`.

### Affected packages
- _BYODC (Docker image) 1.3.65_


## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Big fix: Support fallback temp directories on Android
We've added fallbacks for the temp directories we use on Android when exporting data from TSEs to ensure those exports also work on older Android versions (< Android 8) of specific device vendors. Previously, the Middleware was lacking write permissions on some devices, which lead to failing TAR exports from the Swissbit Hardware TSE. 

This fix may also benefit desktop installations where the Middleware is lacking write permissions to the folder the Launcher is running in.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.AndroidLauncher.Http v1.3.65_
- _fiskaltrust.AndroidLauncher.Grpc v1.3.65_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.Swissbit v1.3.65_
