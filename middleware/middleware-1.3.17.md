# fiskaltrust.Middleware 1.3.17 (Germany)
_March 18, 2021_

This Middleware version contains a hotfix for Diebold Nixdorf SCUs that fixes a potentially blocking issue that could occur while reading the status of the TSE.

<div class="alert alert--warning" role="alert">Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.</div>

## Bug fix: FormatException is thrown by the Diebold Nixdorf SCU
Due to an issue in the Diebold Nixdorf SCU, the following exception could be thrown infrequently on some devices: 
- On German Windows versions: `System.FormatException: Die Eingabezeichenfolge hat das falsche Format.`
- On English Windows versions: `System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format.`

We've resolved these issues, and the Diebold Nixdorf SCU should now operate normally in scenarios where they occurred. We'd also like to thank our partners how helped us investigate this problem and verified the fix!

## Feature: Multiple bring your own datacenter deployments on one cluster
It is now possible to run multiple byodc deployments on a single kubernetes cluster.

## Bug fix: Cannot change bring your own datacenter redis port
We resolved an issue in the byodc helm chart which prevented changing the redis port on the internal redis instance.

## Affected packages
Packages not listed here were not updated, as we decided to not increase the version of unchanged packages. All packages with versions greater or equal to 1.3.1 are compatible with each other (it is e.g. possible to use _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.Swissbit.1.3.1_ with the new queue packages).

- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DieboldNixdorf v1.3.17_

## Next steps in the Middleware
We will continue to improve the stability of our Middleware in the next sprints. As always, we're happy to hear feedback and suggestions via [feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud](mailto:feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud) or directly via issues in our GitHub repositories.
