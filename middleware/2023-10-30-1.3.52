# Middleware 1.3.52 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've fixed an issue where the `NuGetScratch` folder would keep growing and an issue where the Launcher would crash when pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> on linux.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## Bug Fix: `NuGetScratch` folder keeps growing
The Launcher now cleans up the `NuGetScratch` folder on every startup which keeps the folder from growing.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.service.launcher v1.3.52_

## Bug Fix: Launcher crashes when pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>
We've fixed a bug where the Launcher would not shutdown correctly when pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> on linux.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.service.launcher v1.3.52_
