# Middleware 1.2.25241.84793 (Austria, France)
In this version of the French Middleware, we've provided an updated posapi helper to with improved TLS 1.2 support.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.2 of the Middleware is meant for the Austrian and French market only, customers in other markets have to use version 1.3. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## Feature: Improved TLS 1.2 support for the posapi helper

As TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support are being phased out we've updated the posapi helper to use TLS 1.2 per default.
We've also updated the helper to use the urls `https://possystem-api-sandbox.fiskaltrust.eu` and `https://possystem-api.fiskaltrust.eu` which have no support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
If TLS 1.2 is not supported by the operating system
it's still possible to use TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 by setting the `server` configuration parameter to `https://poss-api-sandbox.fiskaltrust.cloud` or `https://pos-api.fiskaltrust.cloud`
and the `forcesecuretlsversion` configuration parameter to `false` in the posapi helper.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.service.helper.posapi v1.2.25241.84793_
