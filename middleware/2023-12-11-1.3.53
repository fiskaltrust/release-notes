# Middleware 1.3.53 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we have updated Receipt responses to include TSE SerialNumber and fixed some issues regarding closing receipts. 

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

:::
## Added TSE SerialNumber on receipt
The TSE SerialNumber has been added to the receipt while the new AEAO / KassenSichV valid from 1.1.2024 requires the TSE serial number to be printed on the receipt if the QR-Code isn't used.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.53_

## Bug Fix: Daily/Monthly/Yearly closing is only halfway processed in Germany when SCU is not reachable. 
The halfway process of closing receipts leads to wrong automatic export ranges - like MeinFiskal and PosArchive which report somehow actionjournals. It has fixed to do a full process and create action journals even though the SCU is not reachable during that time (or fails, e.g. due to timeouts, etc.).

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.53_

## Bug Fix: Update cbReceiptReference exception
We've handled throwing Exceptions regarding single open transactions in the TSE

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*  v1.3.53_
