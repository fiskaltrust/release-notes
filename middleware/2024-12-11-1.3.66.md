# Middleware 1.3.66 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we've added support for cancelling lines within a single receipt (either in charge- or payitems).

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Support line cancellations
In this version of the Middleware, we've added support for cancelling lines within a single receipt (either in charge- or payitems). This is meant to support cases where operators e.g. mistype articles or payments, or customers change their minds after data was entered.

To cancel lines, the canceled ones must have **both their amounts and their quantities reversed**, e.g. `1x 10â‚¬` changes to `-1x -10â‚¬`, and the positions need to be marked with the ftChargeItemCaseFlag/ftPayItemCaseFlag `0x0000000000200000`. 

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Stability improvement: Updated BSI certficitation ID of DeutscheFiskal SCUs
We've updated the certification ID of the _Deutsche Fiskal_ SCU package to the latest version (`BSI-K-TR-0524-2024 ).

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.66_
