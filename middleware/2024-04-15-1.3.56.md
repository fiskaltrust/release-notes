# Middleware 1.3.56 (Germany)
This version of the Middleware contains the Fiskal Cloud Connector (FCC) 4.1.1, which is a **mandatory update** for all users, as it contains updated components that were re-certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security (e.g. the BSI).

:::warn

Please note that this mandatory update of the FCC needs to be rolled out **until July 31st 2024** to remain compliant to the German regulations. The Deutsche Fiskal will disable signing for previous FCC versions on this date.

Refer to [our documentation](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/technical-operations/maintenance/updating) to learn how to update the installations of connected PosOperators.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Update FCC to 4.1.1 in SwissbitCloud and DF SCUs [fiskaltrust/middleware#275](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/275)
We've updated the _Fiskal Cloud Connector_ (the background service used by the _Deutsche Fiskal_ and _SwissbitCloud_ TSEs) to the latest version, which **includes a re-certified CSP component and is therefore mandatory to use**. When updating to this version of the SCU, the new FCC version is automatically installed on the next start of the Middleware.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.55_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud v1.3.55_
