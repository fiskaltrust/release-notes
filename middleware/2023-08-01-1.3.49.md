# Middleware 1.3.49 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we added support for the final version of the CryptoVision TSE (v2) to our existing _SCU.DE.CryptoVision_ package.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

:::

## Feature: Support for CryptoVision TSE v2
We've added full support for the newly released CryptoVision v2 TSE to our existing Cryptovision package. The SCU automatically detects the connected TSEs version, and is therefore fully downwards-compatible (i.e. it is possible to use a v1 CryptoVision TSE with the latest version of this SCU package).

**Please note that switching from a v1 to a v2 CryptoVision requires the SCU switch progress, which is described [in this KBA](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/KBArticle#/KA-01112)**.
