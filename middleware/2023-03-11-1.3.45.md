# Middleware 1.3.45-rc1 (Italy)
We are happy to announce that with this version of the fiskaltrust Middleware we have published our first release candidate for the coverage of the italian market. This version is currently only available in the [italian sandbox Portal](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.it) and should give our partners the possibility to start their integration for Italy.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the german and italian market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.
