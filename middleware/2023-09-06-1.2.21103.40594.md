# Middleware 1.161.6.6274 SignaturCloud (France)
In this version of the French Middleware, we've improved the performance of the copy receipt.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.2 of the Middleware is meant for the Austrian and French market only, customers in Germany have to use version 1.3. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

:::

## Feature: Improved the performance of the copy receipt
We've improved the performance of the French Middleware when dealing with copy receipts by counting the copy receipts through the journalfr base64 decoded payload, for the SignaturCloud.
More details can be found in on [Github](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/blob/main/rfcs/0192-fr-copy-receipt-performance.md)

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.service.azure v1.2.23219.65461-rc1_

## Next steps in the Middleware
We will focus on finalizing the next version of the fiskaltrust.Launcher in the next sprints.
This version is developed open-source, and our first public preview can be found in the public repository https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware-launcher.

As always, we're happy to hear feedback and suggestions via [feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud](mailto:feedback+middleware@fiskaltrust.cloud) or directly via issues in our GitHub repositories.
