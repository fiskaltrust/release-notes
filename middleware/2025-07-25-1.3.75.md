# Middleware 1.3.75
 [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/milestone-v1.3.75-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/milestone/7?closed=1)

 
In this version of the Middleware, our focus was on a range of improvements and fixes tailored primarily for the German market.
<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only (with Spain, Greece, and Portugal currently in the works).
Customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
We are currently testing a unified version for all markets.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: Incorrect SignatureAlgorithm shown in signatures ([fiskaltrust/middleware#482](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/482))

The SignatureAlgorithm specified by the SwissbitCloudV2 SCU in the QR-Code and the `<sig-alg>` signature was previously incorrect. This means the previously created QR-Codes fail vaildation. This has already been deployed in the CloudCashbox and when using the local middleware this will be fixed after updating the SCU to the new version. 

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2_

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Better error handling for HTTP requests in SwissbitCloudV2 ([fiskaltrust/middleware#458](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/458))

We introduced enhanced error handling for HTTP requests in the SwissbitCloudV2. This ensures that failed HTTP responses are not silently ignored. Instead, detailed error informationâ€”such as the status code and response contentâ€”is captured and thrown via a custom SwissbitCloudV2Exception.

This change improves transparency and debuggability for operations, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues when communication with the Swissbit Cloud API fails.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2_
  
## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Performance improvements for Azure Table Storage-based Queues and Cloud TSEs ([fiskaltrust/middleware#454](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/454))

These changes introduce enhancements intended to boost efficiency and reliability for the CloudCashbox and users of the AzureTableStorage queue and SwissbitCloudV2 and FisskalyCertified SCUs.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloudV2_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.FisskalyCertified_
  
## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: Perform a TAR-File Export on Out-Of-Operation Receipts

We now perform a last TAR-File export after processing of the Out-Of-Operation receipt so that all signatures get exported from the TSE before the queue is decommissioned.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_
  
## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Bug Fix: Fiskaly Exports not using the Temp folder ([fiskaltrust/middleware#461](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/461))

We resolved the issue where temporary files were not being created in the temporary folder. This caused troubles on Linux with readonly filesystems.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.FiskalyCertified_

## Bug Fix: Invalid error responses returned with the ReceiptRequest flag ([fiskaltrust/middleware#469](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/469))

When a failed receipt, and was requested again with the ReceipRequest flag the middleware would sometimes return a response with the the ftState `0xEEEE_EEEE` instead of returning an empty result.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Feature: Daily-Closing Flag which closes all open transactions ([fiskaltrust/middleware#212](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/212))

We introduced a new [ftReceiptCaseFlag (0x0000000200000000)](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/germany/reference-tables/ftreceiptcase#ftreceiptcaseflag) to the Daily Closing, which closes all open transactions on the TSE when a daily closing is performed.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.*_
