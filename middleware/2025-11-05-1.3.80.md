# Middleware 1.3.80
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/milestone-v1.3.80-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/milestone/12?closed=1)

This release we've improved TAR-File export handling in the Queue, FiskalyCertified and SwissbitCloudV2 SCUs for the **German** market.

:::info

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is intended for the German and Italian markets only (with Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, and Spain currently in development).
Customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
A preview of the unified 1.3 Middleware for Austria and France is already available.

## 🇩🇪 Feature: Improved TAR-File Export handling in Zero Receipt ([fiskaltrust/middleware#549](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/549))

When performing a Zero-Receipt with the flag "Requests a download of the TSE-device TAR file" (`0x0000_0000_0200_0000`) the TAR-File export is now also attempted if the signing failed.  

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL_

## 🇩🇪 Feature: Allow TAR-File deletion from SwissbitCloudV2 with open transactions ([fiskaltrust/middleware#549](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/549))

The TAR-File can now be deleted from the SwissbitCloudV2 TSE after an export even if there are open transactions on the TSE.

::: note

If the TSE refuses to sign receipts because its storage is full, sending a Zero-Receipt with the "Requests a download of the TSE-device TAR file" (`0x0000_0000_0200_0000`) from a Queue >= v1.3.80 fixes the issue.

## 🇩🇪 Fix: Fiskaly TAR-File Export fails with `E_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` ([fiskaltrust/middleware#561](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/561))

We've fixed an issue where TAR-File Exports from a FiskalyCertified TSE would fail with a `E_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` error.  
In some cases long running TAR-File Exports might take a few seconds longer due to this change.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL_
