# Middleware 1.3.41 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we have increased the default fiskaly timeout to enable longer TAR export to be performed successfully, and improved the Arm compatibility of the Swissbit and SQLite packages. Additionally, we have increased the default timeout of the Helipad helper as well as added a new configuration parameter to specify the concurrent upload count of TAR files.
Additionally, we have added ARMEL support to our SQLite packages. And finally we have created a script which helps generating indexes for MySQL databases used in a bring your own data center environment.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.
