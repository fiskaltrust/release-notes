## 🇩🇪 Feature: Automatically close open transactions on the TSE with the Daily-Closing ([fiskaltrust/middleware#554](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/pull/554))

We've added a queue configuration parameter `CloseOpenTSETransactionsOnDailyClosing` which is set to `false` per default.
When set to `true` the queue will close all open transactions on the TSE automatically with each daily closing.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.AzureTableStorage_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL_
