# Middleware 1.3.67 (Italy)
In this version of the Middleware our main focus was adding additional functionalities as well as some devex improvements for Italy.

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Feature: Support for custom fields on printed receipts ([fiskaltrust/middleware#383](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/383))

Similar to the Digital Receipt functionalities we allow the caller to define additional receipt lines that are printed onto receipt. This functionality works across the whole receipt stack.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.IT.EpsonRTPrinter v1.3.67_

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Dev Experience: Add warning SignaturItem for paper running out ([fiskaltrust/middleware#387](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/387))

The SCU EpsonPrinter will return an error message in cases where the paper is empty. The Printer also has information for paper running empty and with this realease we return this warning to the caller. You will see this information in the ftSignatures as a Warning Signature.

:::caution

We recommend not parsing the JSON in the Data body since this is subject to change in the future and will likely break your implementation if changed.

### Affected packages:

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Feature: Add local Flag for printing protocol receipt ([fiskaltrust/middleware#386](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/386))

There are some use cases of integrators that require a so called "non fiscal" document to be printed. While we have a type that could match to this type of receipt, we want to make sure that there is no unnecessary printing.

For this reason we have introduced a new flag that supports printing documents. This flag works only with EpsonRTPrinters and has no effect on any other type of SCU.

#### lll - local tagging/flag 

| **Value** | **Description** | **Middleware version** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `002` | **Print as non fiscal document**<br /><br />(Only for RT Devices - only for Protocol receipts) Prints the protcol receipt  | 1.3.67 |

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.IT.EpsonRTPrinter v1.3.67_


## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Dev Experience: Improve error messages for failed receipt lookups ([fiskaltrust/middleware#382](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/382))

When using Void/Refund or Copy receipt types we have been returning a NullReferenceException in case we have been unable to find a matching receipt with reference items. This has been changed and now a better error message is returned to the caller.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.* v1.3.67_

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Bug: Lookup for ReceiptReference does not work if multiple terminals are used with the same queue ([fiskaltrust/middleware#381](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/issues/381))

When using Void/Refund or Copy receipt types we have been looking up receipts based on the cbPreviousReceiptReference and if set the cbTerminalID. This led to issues especially in scenarios where more than one device was used. We have fixed this behavior to only filter by cbTerminalID if there is a receipt with a matching ReceiptReference.

### Affected packages
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.* v1.3.67_
