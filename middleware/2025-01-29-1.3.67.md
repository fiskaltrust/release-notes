# Middleware 1.3.67 (Italy)
In this version of the Middleware, we've added support for cancelling lines within a single receipt (either in charge- or payitems).

<!--truncate-->

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We are currently testing a unified version for all markets, and will release an update about this soon.
