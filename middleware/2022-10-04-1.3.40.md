# Middleware 1.3.40 (Germany)
In this version of the Middleware, we have added a SCU parameter to configure the Heap memory of the FCC, we also have added a queue parameter to configure the migrations timeout, we have modified the DSFINV-K export to exclude non pos-receipts lowering memory consumption, we have created some modi for the TAR-Export and we have fixed bugs regarding failing TAR-Export using a Fiskaly SCU and a bug concerning the indexes creation.

:::caution

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German market only, customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2. We will unify these experiences in an upcoming version.

## Feature: Heap memory is now configurable for DeutscheFiskal and SwissbitCloud SCUs
We made it possible to configure the heap memory thanks to an optional SCU parameter called `SetFccHeapMemory` with the following values 256, 512, 1024 for DeutscheFiskal and SwissbitCloud SCUs.

### Affected packages:

- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.DeutscheFiskal v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.DE.SwissbitCloud v1.3.40_

## Feature: Excluding non pos-receipts in DSFINV-K export
We have modified the DSFINV-K export so that non pos-receipts (e.g. zero receipt, daily or monthly closing receipt...) are not part of it, anymore. It should create lighter databases and save memory and CPU cycle.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite v1.3.40_

## Feature: Queue migration timeout is now configurable
We have made it possible to configure the migration timeout duration for queues by adding the key-value pair parameter MigrationsTimeoutSec to the queue configuration. In some cases when performing a migration for big queues the default timeout was not long enough leading to some errors.

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite v1.3.40_

## Feature: TAR export modi for the queue
We have added several TAR export modi for the queue for the TAR-File export during the daily closing to avoid a growth of the database due to open transactions. We noticed that more and more database size were increasing leading to issues in terms of perfomance and data upload.To solve this issue we implemented a queue parameter allowing to configure different modi for the TAR-File export:
- all, this mode enables the automatic TAR-File export from the TSE on the queue
- none, this mode disables the automatic TAR-File export
- erased, this mode works in a way that TAR-files are only exported and saved when they can be deleted from the TSE. 

### Affected packages:
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.EF v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.MySQL v1.3.40_
- _fiskaltrust.Middleware.Queue.SQLite v1.3.40_
