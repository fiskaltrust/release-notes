# A-Trust smartcard tool 1.2.2 (Austria)
We've updated our smartcard personalization tool to make it compatible with the latest ACOS-ID smartcards distributed by A-Trust. Old card generations continue to be supported.

The latest version can be downloaded in the [Portal's download area](https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/AccountProfile/Download) both for Windows x86 and x64.

**In contrast to the old tool, it's not required (or recommended) anymore to install the a.sign client tool and the .NET framework 4.5.** The new version contains all required dependencies.
