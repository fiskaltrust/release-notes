 [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/milestone-v1.3.76-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware/milestone/9?closed=1)

 
In this version of the Middleware, our focus was on a range of improvements and fixes tailored primarily for the German market..

Version 1.3 of the Middleware is meant for the German and Italian markets only (with Spain, Greece, and Portugal currently in the works).
Customers in Austria and France should continue to use version 1.2.
